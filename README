Commands to compile:
--------------------

$ gcc -c -g -fPIC -Wall PythonC.c
$ gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,libmypythonc.so -o libmypythonc.so.1.0.0 PythonC.o 

The first command creates a position independent object code with debug symbols. And 
the second command creates a shared library file with the filename specified as part 
of -o switch using the object file compiled in the previous step.

Once you compile and create the shared library file, fire up your python interpreter 
and try out the examples in the accompanying python script file. Lines that are 
triple quoted are outputs on running the commands in your interpreter. 

Note: You need to change the path to the library on your machine in the python script.
You can try setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH using os.environ, but it didn't work for me and 
I decided to give full path. 

If you find any errors or inaccuracies in this document or in the code, find me and 
circle me on Google+ and then bash me ;) I am open to constructive criticism.
